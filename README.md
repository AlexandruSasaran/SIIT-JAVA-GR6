Will submit the homework as a git commit, like last time. Please make sure you separate the homework code from the class exercises.

Requirements:

1. You need to store Persoane in a TreeSet. Define 2 Comparators (one for name - nume and one for age-varsta) that will be used when creating the TreeSet;

Add Persoane to the TreeSet; iterate throug the treeset and print the name and the age;
NOTE: if you are using a Comparator, the class Persoana should not implement Comparable anymore. 

2. You need to store some information about some persons: for one person, you need a list of his/her hobbies;

Define for Hobby a class that contains:

Name of hobby (String) – eq: cycling, swimming
Frequency (int) – how many times a week they practice it
List of Addresses where this hobby can be practiced (List<Adresa>)
You will use a HashMap

<Persoana, List<Hobby>>

NOTE: equals() from Persoana must be overriden

Add some information to this map; for a certain Persoana, print the names of the hobbies and the countries where it can be practiced

USE THE ALREADY DEFINED CLASSES: PERSOANA, SOMER, ANGAJAT, STUDENT; ADRESA; TARA;
